  {"id":"burrillSyntheticCircuitIdentifies2011","abstract":"Differential responses to stimuli can affect how cells succumb to disease. In yeast, DNA damage can create heterogeneous responses. To delineate how a response contributes to a cell's future behavior, we constructed a transcription-based memory circuit that detects DNA repair to isolate subpopulations with heritable damage responses. Strongly responsive cells show multigenerational effects, including growth defects and iron-associated gene expression. Less-responsive cells exhibit increased mutation frequencies but resume wild-type behavior. These two subpopulations remain distinct for multiple generations, indicating a transmissible memory of damage. Collectively, this work demonstrates the efficacy of using synthetic biology to define how environmental exposure contributes to distinct cell fates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Burrill","given":"Devin R."},{"family":"Silver","given":"Pamela A."}],"citation-key":"burrillSyntheticCircuitIdentifies2011","container-title":"Genes & Development","container-title-short":"Genes Dev.","DOI":"10.1101/gad.1994911","ISSN":"0890-9369, 1549-5477","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"434-439","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Synthetic circuit identifies subpopulations with sustained memory of DNA damage","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://genesdev.cshlp.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/gad.1994911","volume":"25"},
