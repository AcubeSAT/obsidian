## PARA

You can categorize entries following a high-level technique named **PARA**. Each letter stands for a category, and if you deem that the respective entry does not belong to that category, you move on to check if it belongs to the next:

-   **P**rojects: a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.  
    "In which project will this be most useful?". Tasks you're working at right now
-   **A**reas: A sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time.  
    "In which area will this be most useful?". Long-term commitments that don't have a due date
-   **R**esources: A topic or theme of ongoing interest.  
    "Which resource does this belong to?". Resources you might want to reference in the future
-   **A**rchives: Inactive items from the other three categories.  
    Things you've completed or are no longer working on (review is important for this)

On that matter, some additional generic tips: Don't organize by source, organize by actionability, as mentioned above. "Where will I use this information?". In other words, organize for project, not by topic. Every now and then, as part of a review, make a list with your various projects. Then make another list with your goals. Draw lines to connect entries from the two. One goal can be connected to multiple projects, and vice-versa. If there's a lot of entries in your lists that remain unconnected, you need to re-evaluate.

Oh, and something else that helped me get this straight: The important distinction between **P**rojects and **A**reas is the deadline. Projects _always_ fall into Areas. A task can belong to no Project, but it has to belong to an Area.
