## CODE

CODE refers to the various steps that constitute your pipeline for a new entry, as well as their order:

-   **C**ollect
-   **O**rganize
-   **D**istill
-   **E**xpress

Collect is the first step, and refers on capturing information. Organize comes directly after, and is where you tidy the information according to the overall structure you're going for. Distill is third, and it is where, selectively, you opt to really dig deep and extract the key aspects of a high-value note. Express is last, where you can "package" the information to share it with others (and your future self!).

Collect should be _separate_ from Organize. Don't have the mental burden on where to put the things you capture, just capture them. Organize should happen _opportunisticly_, only when you want to _use_ the information. A nifty trick that might come in handy can be defining favorite problems, just like Feynman's 12 favorite problems. Then, each time you come across some information, either during the Capture or, even better the Organize step, you first check if it's relevant to any of your problems.

You can also refer to [[PARA]].
