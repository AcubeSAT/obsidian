## Notetaking Tips

### General

The notes, including any drawings or even icons, should be atomic and modular. [[Work With The Garage Door Up]]. [[Anti-marketing]]. [[Work With The Garage Door Up]]. Adopt the mindset of a curator - objective, opinionated and reflective; in a deliberate way. Keep only what resonates; focus on actionability and _relevance to projects_. Be opportunistic, don't create entries in advance, further compress them and refine them only when needed.

Keep few notes (2-6) per day: Does it inspire me? Is it personal? Is it surprising? Is it useful? Keep things off the working memory. Take into account the magic number of 4, e.g. don't have more than 4 nested subdirectories. Try to use as few sources as possible.

In other words, there's no need to organize unless you need to organize. No need to figure out the system first, it will gradually come into existence through an iterative process. Keep all organization, thinking, etc. to a minimum, don't unecessarily complicate. Prioritize less friction; separate the various subprocesses, e.g. separate **C**ollecting from **O**rganizing (see [[CODE]]) . Don't use a lot of (app) features, it's a rabbit hole.

Eventually as your system matures, everything should ideally be almost a remix; minimize new research. Mix and match already conquered knowledge, apply already-made observations instead. Build different things from the same blocks. You can think about treating every entry across the pipeline as packaging it for your future self. Last but definitely, definitely not least, share frequently. Get as much feedback as possible, at every step along the way. Don't think about that 10000 hours rule. Don't think in hours, days or weeks; think in feedback cycles.

### Process

You can have the following serve as a draft guideline template on what and when to do during the day. Each day, decide what your tasks will be. What will you work on? At which order? You should pay more attention to the first tasks of the day. A good recurring process is allocating some time (e.g. daily or weekly) to do a quick review for what's coming ahead. This will help you better determine the upcoming tasks and their order. You can also do more lengthy, in-depth reviews, e.g. once per month, to reflect back on your progress, how your system is working, and to cross-check progress toward the more long-term goals.

You can split your tasks into "process", or background tasks, and immersive tasks. Always keep at the back of your head that background tasks are more important than immersive tasks. Identify the small things you can do that will start, little by little, unlocking great value, e.g. asking a question about an upcoming meeting early in the morning to have a larger buffer time for everyone to respond and any potential followup discussion. Another thing you can do, like a chef, is to use placeholder for your open loops, i.e. tasks that you've started and are currently pending more work _by you_ before they can be considered completed. You can treat everything that you must devote your time to as a request. You should externalize, offload these requests from your mind and congnition to your (mostly digital) surroundings. For example, jot down a thought somewhere, add an event or reminder to your calendar, capture an open loop with your task manager/kanban board...

What's more important is arguably adopting a so-called finishing mindset. If something is at 99% but not finished, it's of zero value. Plus, finishing a tangible chunk of work means you get to have feedback. Yay! "How and when will I finish this?". Do not formulate a plan for starting tasks, rather, make a plan for finishing them.
