## Description

https://acubesat.gitlab.io/documentation/obsidian/

This repository hosts a complete [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault, together with plugins, configuration, etc.
As some [SpaceDot](https://spacedot.gr/) members are starting to experiment with using Obsidian for notetaking in the scope of the [AcubeSAT](https://acubesat.spacedot.gr/) project, this is an attempt to gather everything in a single, centralized knowledge base.
Additionally, this repository contains all the necessary files for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) integration, using [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/).
This allows for automatically building and deploying a [website](https://acubesat.gitlab.io/documentation/obsidian/) generated by the markdown notes, through [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/):
